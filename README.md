## Overview

This challenge was to create a weather app using the Open Weather API
​

### The challenge

Creating a weather app, including city name, date, icon of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index currently. Also must include a five day forecast including most of the prior, and a search history using local storage

### User Story

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## My process

1. The first thing I did was write sudo code to figure out exactly what needed to be done. Following this I created a large portion of the DOM elements, then worked on getting the API call working with the user being able to enter their own city.
2. After I got these to work properly, I made a mockup of how I wanted the site to look, and jotted down notes about smaller things I needed to do.
3. Once all of this was done, I sprinted to the finish line, working on getting all of the data that I needed to display to the page on the page.
4. After getting all of the data on the page, I used bootstrap to clean it up and make the page much MUCH more readable.
5. Finally, I did the UV color changer and the local storage history.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Open Weather API

### What I learned

- I learned a lot about working with local storage and APIs.
- I also learned a lot about global and local variables and how to use them.

### Continued development

- CODE MORE. CODE MORE. CODE MORE. CODE MORE. CODE MORE. CODE MORE.

### Useful resources

- Stack Overflow, MDN web docs, and W3 Schools
